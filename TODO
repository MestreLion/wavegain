- Investigate why 64-bit executable corrupt some test files by chopping audio and
    changing its pitch. Original windows binary was 32 bits, and to prevent this bug
    so is this build, forcedly by using GCC's -m32 flag. Proof-reading is required to
    see what triggers the bug in 64-bits binaries and, to hopefully allow for a non-buggy
    native AMD64 build in the future.
- Consider generating a 32-bit binary instead of 64 using GCC's `-m32` flag.
    Original binary was 32 bits, the convertion to 64 never had any proof-reading, 
    and this might be the root cause of several bugs.
- Bugfix: percentages sometimes show > 100% done
- Bugfix: investigate calculated RG gain when --gain and DC correction is used,
   also how these are affected by --limiter, --noclip, etc
- Fix --help linux issues (copyright at bottom, * ? as Wildcard)
   if possible, make it convertable to nroff (man page) and/or html (manual),
   so the 3 are always in sync
- Standard license/copyright headers in all sources
